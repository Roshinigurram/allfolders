        Mike and Morris lived in the same village.
        While Morris owned the largest jewelry shop in the village, Mike was a poor farmer.
        Both had large families with many sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.
        One fine day, Mike, tired of not being able to feed his family,
        decided to leave the village and move to the city where he was certain to earn enough to feed everyone.
